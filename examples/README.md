# Examples

The following examples are here to help you getting started and adding new complex functionnalities to your bots. By using them, you will improve the speed of development for each of your bots.

You have access to *snippets* of code and graphical *demonstration* for each example so you know exactly what you will get and how to implement it.

### Where to find examples

You can find examples here on [our Github](https://github.com/botpress/botpress/examples), but your can also look at them on [our website](https://botpres.io/examples) where you will have a better overview.

### How to use examples

What you need to do is to look at the following examples, follow the step-by-step guide that have been created for you and copy-paste the section you need in your code.

### Add a new example

We always appreciate when people are contributing and helping us making our tool better and easier to use every day. So, you are all welcome to create a new example that might help others.

#### 1. Create it

First of all, you will need to create your example by coding it. Before starting, take some time to be certain that there's not another example in our list is already available for the same usecase.

Please, take the time to be sure that there's no error in your code and if there's an upgrade or you find a better way of doing it, update your code if you can.


##### Folder's structure to respect

```js
  description.json
  demonstration.gif
  README.md
```

#### 2. Create a descriptiion file

In your repo, you will need to add a `description.json` file. We need this file for our website to add *title*, *description* and *author* to each example.

```js
{
  "title": "Hello world",
  "description": "Short example of an hello world bot.",
  "author": "Dany Fortin-Simard"
}
```

#### 3. Record a GIF

To show a demo of your example on our website we need to have a short GIF that shows what it is doing concretly. The GIF needs to respect the standard ratio of *9:16* that almost every cellphone respects.

Here, we added some links to help you find an app to be able to record your screen on your personal mobile.

- [Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duapps.recorder)
- [Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder)

#### 3. Write a short README.md

This is the most important 

#### 4. Create a pull request

The last step is to create a pull request so we will add your new example to our list. We will review each example to be sure that there's no error, it is pertinent and we have everyting we need to sync it with our website.

## Get inspired
