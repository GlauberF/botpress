# Examples

The following examples are there to help, improve the speed of development and help to add complex functionnalities to your bots.
You have access to source code and graphical demonstration for each example so you know exactly what you will get.

### Where to find examples

You can find examples here on our Github, but your can also look at them on [Botpress website](https://botpres.io/examples) where you will have a better overview.

### How to use examples

It's easy to use examples. You only need to look at the following examples and to copy-paste the portion you need in your code.

### Add a new example

We always appreciate when people are contributing and helping us making Botpress better every day. So, you are welcome to create a new example that might help others.

#### 1. Create it

First of all, you will need to create your example by coding it. Please, take the time to be sure that there's no error in your code and if there's an upgrade of Botpress, update it if you can.


##### Folder's structure to respect

```js
  description.json
  demonstration.gif
  README.md
```

#### 2. Create a descriptiion file

In your repo, you will need to add a `description.json` file. We need this file for our website to add *title*, *description* and *author* to each example.

```js
{
  "title": "Hello world",
  "description": "Short example of an hello world bot.",
  "author": "Dany Fortin-Simard"
}
```

#### 3. Record a GIF

To show a demo of your example on our website we need to have a short GIF that shows what it is doing concretly. The GIF needs to respect the standard ratio of *9:16* that almost every cellphone respects.

Here, we added some links to help you find an app to be able to record your screen on your personal mobile.

- [Screen Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder)

#### 3. Write a short README.md

This is the most important 

#### 4. Create a pull request

The last step is to create a pull request so we will add your new example to our list. We will review each example to be sure that there's no error, it is pertinent and we have everyting we need to sync it with our website.
